# Disabled Features Implementation - Phase 1

## Task Objective
Implement the temporarily disabled features in the application, focusing on chat and knowledge base functionality.

## Current State Assessment
Several API endpoints are currently disabled for the build:
- Chat AI stream endpoint
- Chat session endpoint
- Chat AI response endpoint
- Knowledge Base categories endpoint

## Future State Goal
All disabled endpoints should be fully implemented with proper error handling, rate limiting, and monitoring.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Chat AI Stream Implementation**
   - [ ] Review existing AI stream implementation in `app/api/chat/ai-stream/route.ts`
   - [ ] Implement proper streaming response handling
   - [ ] Add rate limiting
   - [ ] Add error handling and logging
   - [ ] Add monitoring for stream health
   - [ ] Test with different message types and sizes

2. **Chat Session Management**
   - [ ] Review existing session implementation in `app/api/chat/session/route.ts`
   - [ ] Implement session creation and management
   - [ ] Add session persistence
   - [ ] Implement session cleanup for inactive chats
   - [ ] Add session recovery mechanisms
   - [ ] Test session handling under various conditions

3. **Chat AI Response System**
   - [ ] Review existing AI response setup in `app/api/chat/ai-response/route.ts`
   - [ ] Implement AI response generation
   - [ ] Add response caching where appropriate
   - [ ] Implement fallback mechanisms
   - [ ] Add response validation
   - [ ] Test response quality and timing

4. **Knowledge Base Categories**
   - [ ] Review KB categories implementation in `app/api/kb/categories/route.ts`
   - [ ] Implement category management
   - [ ] Add category hierarchy support
   - [ ] Implement category caching
   - [ ] Add category search and filtering
   - [ ] Test category system performance

5. **Integration and Testing**
   - [ ] Add integration tests for all implemented features
   - [ ] Implement end-to-end tests
   - [ ] Add performance monitoring
   - [ ] Document API endpoints
   - [ ] Update API documentation

## Dependencies
- Supabase project configuration
- Redis instance (for caching)
- AI model access (for chat responses)
- Environment variables:
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
  - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
  - AI_MODEL_API_KEY
  - REDIS_URL

## Notes
- Ensure proper error handling across all implementations
- Implement rate limiting for all endpoints
- Add monitoring and logging
- Consider implementing circuit breakers for external services
- Plan for scalability and high availability
