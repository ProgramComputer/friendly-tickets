# Ticket System Implementation - Phase 1
Created: 2024-01-22

## Task Objective
Implement core ticket functionality with role-based access control and appropriate features for customers, employees, and admins.

## Current State Assessment
- Basic ticket system exists with:
  - Tickets table with status and priority as enums
  - Team members and customers tables
  - Basic ticket messages
- Just added:
  - Enhanced ticket responses system
  - Ticket history tracking
  - Role-based security policies

## Future State Goal
Comprehensive ticket system where:
- Customers can create and track their tickets
- Team members can manage and respond to tickets
- Admins can oversee, assign, and manage ticket workflows

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Schema Status âœ“
Current schema includes:
```sql
-- Existing core tables
tickets (
    id, title, description, status ticket_status, 
    priority ticket_priority, customer_id, assignee_id,
    department, metadata, created_at, updated_at
)

team_members (
    id, user_id, email, name, role team_member_role,
    avatar_url, department, created_at, updated_at
)

customers (
    id, user_id, email, name, avatar_url,
    company, created_at, updated_at
)

-- Newly added tables
ticket_responses (
    id, ticket_id, sender_type message_sender_type,
    sender_id, content, is_internal, created_at, updated_at
)

ticket_history (
    id, ticket_id, changed_by, field_name,
    old_value, new_value, created_at
)
```

### 2. UI Components Priority

1. Ticket Detail View (New)
- [ ] Response thread UI
  - [ ] Support for internal notes
  - [ ] Rich text editor
  - [ ] Role-based visibility
- [ ] Status/Priority updates
- [ ] History log display
- [ ] Assignment controls

2. Ticket List Enhancements
- [ ] Status and priority badges
- [ ] Department filtering
- [ ] Assignment status
- [ ] Quick actions menu

3. Ticket Creation Form
- [ ] Department selection
- [ ] Priority selection
- [ ] Rich text description
- [ ] Initial assignment options (admin)

### 3. API Endpoints Needed
```typescript
// Customer endpoints
POST /api/tickets/create
GET /api/tickets/my-tickets
POST /api/tickets/{id}/respond

// Team Member endpoints
GET /api/tickets/queue
PATCH /api/tickets/{id}/status
POST /api/tickets/{id}/respond
GET /api/tickets/{id}/history

// Admin endpoints
PATCH /api/tickets/{id}/assign
POST /api/tickets/bulk-update
GET /api/tickets/metrics
```

### 4. Testing Requirements
- [ ] Role-based access control tests
- [ ] Ticket workflow tests
- [ ] Response system tests
- [ ] History tracking tests
- [ ] UI component tests

## Next Steps
1. Generate TypeScript types for new schema
2. Build ticket detail view
3. Enhance ticket list with new fields
4. Implement response system UI
5. Add history display components

## Success Metrics
- All roles can perform their specific actions
- Ticket updates are tracked in history
- Response system works for both internal and external communication
- Performance remains stable with increased ticket volume
