# UI/UX Optimization Phase 1: Screenshot Analysis & Enhancements

## Task Objective
Analyze screenshot test results and implement fixes for identified issues in accessibility, performance, and error handling.

## Current State Assessment
- Screenshot tests reveal several accessibility gaps and performance concerns
- Multiple 406 errors occurring in team member role queries
- React hydration and controlled input warnings present
- Missing ARIA labels and form labels in multiple components
- Large images and high element counts impacting performance

## Future State Goal
- Achieve 100% accessibility compliance across all pages
- Eliminate all 406 errors and React warnings
- Optimize image sizes and reduce element counts
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Enhance form validation and input handling

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Fix API and Data Fetching Issues
- [ ] Investigate and fix 406 errors in team member role queries
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries for API failures
- [ ] Implement loading states for data fetching
- [ ] Fix Next.js dynamic route parameter usage warning

### 2. Enhance Accessibility
- [ ] Add missing ARIA labels:
  - [ ] Profile page (1 label)
  - [ ] Ticket creation (2 labels + 1 ARIA)
  - [ ] Ticket list (1 label + 2 ARIA)
- [ ] Implement proper form labels for all inputs
- [ ] Add descriptive alt text for all images
- [ ] Ensure proper heading hierarchy

### 3. Optimize Performance
- [ ] Optimize large images on ticket list and profile pages
- [ ] Reduce element count on ticket list page (currently 229)
- [ ] Implement proper image loading strategies
- [ ] Add proper caching for static assets

### 4. Fix React Warnings
- [ ] Address uncontrolled to controlled input warnings
- [ ] Fix hydration mismatch warnings
- [ ] Implement proper form state management
- [ ] Add proper key props where missing

### 5. Component-Specific Fixes

#### Ticket List Page
- [ ] Fix missing labels (1) and ARIA labels (2)
- [ ] Optimize element count (229 -> target <150)
- [ ] Add proper loading states
- [ ] Implement error handling for failed queries

#### Ticket Creation Page
- [ ] Add missing form labels (2)
- [ ] Add missing ARIA label (1)
- [ ] Fix input control warnings
- [ ] Enhance form validation feedback

#### Profile Page
- [ ] Add missing ARIA label
- [ ] Optimize profile image loading
- [ ] Implement proper form validation
- [ ] Add success/error notifications

## Questions for Discussion
1. Should we implement lazy loading for the ticket list to reduce initial element count?
2. Do we need to add role-specific accessibility features?
3. Should we implement progressive image loading for profile pictures?
4. What is the target performance budget for each page?
