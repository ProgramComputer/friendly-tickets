# SQL Command Rollback System - Phase 1: Implementation

## Task Objective
Ensure all SQL commands executed through the AI Assistant are transactional and support rollback functionality.

## Current State Assessment
- Transaction support exists with `begin_command_transaction` and `rollback_command_transaction` functions
- Command data stored in `chat_messages.command_data` as JSONB
- UI component for rollback exists but needs standardization
- Not all SQL commands are currently wrapped in transactions

## Future State Goal
- All SQL commands executed through AI Assistant must be transactional
- Consistent rollback behavior across all command types
- Clear UI indication of rollback capability
- Proper error handling and state management

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Standardize Command Execution
- [ ] Ensure all SQL commands are wrapped in transactions
- [ ] Add transaction ID to all command results
- [ ] Set `canRollback: true` for all SQL modifying commands
- [ ] Add proper error handling for failed transactions

### 2. Update Command Processing
- [ ] Modify hybrid chain to always use transactions for SQL commands
- [ ] Add transaction logging for audit purposes
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup of old transactions
- [ ] Add validation to prevent conflicting transactions

### 3. UI Improvements
- [ ] Show rollback UI for all SQL commands
- [ ] Add clear success/failure states
- [ ] Improve error messaging
- [ ] Add confirmation dialog for rollback action

### 4. Testing
- [ ] Test rollback functionality for all command types
- [ ] Verify transaction isolation
- [ ] Test concurrent command execution
- [ ] Validate UI state updates

## Technical Notes
- All SQL commands executed through the AI Assistant must:
  1. Be wrapped in a transaction
  2. Include a transaction ID
  3. Set `canRollback: true` in command result
  4. Handle rollback gracefully
- Command results should follow this structure:
  ```typescript
  interface CommandResult {
    success: boolean
    message: string
    transactionId: string
    canRollback: true  // Always true for SQL commands
    data?: any
  }
  ```
- Rollback UI should be shown for all SQL commands, not just specific types
- Error handling should provide clear feedback about what went wrong

## Dependencies
- Existing transaction support functions ✓
- Command data storage in chat_messages ✓
- UI components for rollback ✓
- Role-based access control ✓

## Next Steps
1. Update command processing to standardize transaction usage
2. Modify UI to show rollback option for all SQL commands
3. Implement comprehensive testing
4. Update documentation and examples
