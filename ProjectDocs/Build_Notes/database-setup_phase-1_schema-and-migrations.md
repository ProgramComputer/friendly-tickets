# Database Setup Phase 1: Schema and Migrations

## Task Objective
Set up the initial database schema for the ticket system and establish proper migration practices.

## Current State Assessment
- Basic schema exists but needs proper migration management
- RLS policies were causing issues with seeding
- Migration files were being modified directly instead of creating new ones

## Future State Goal
- Clean schema with proper tables and constraints
- Working seed script for test data
- Established migration practices following `.cursorrules` guidelines

## Implementation Plan

1. Schema Setup
   - [x] Create initial schema with core tables (customers, team_members, tickets, messages)
   - [x] Add proper constraints and indexes
   - [x] Remove RLS temporarily for development

2. Migration Management
   - [x] Create new migration for removing RLS
   - [x] Add ticket constraints in separate migration
   - [x] Add message constraints in separate migration
   - [x] Document proper migration practices in `.cursorrules`

3. Data Seeding
   - [x] Fix service role configuration
   - [x] Test seeding with test users
   - [x] Verify data integrity

4. Next Steps
   - [ ] Re-implement RLS with proper policies
   - [ ] Add more test scenarios to seed script
   - [ ] Generate and update TypeScript types
