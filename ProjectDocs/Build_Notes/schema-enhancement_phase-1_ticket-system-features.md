# Schema Enhancement Phase 1: Ticket System Features

## Task Objective
Enhance the ticket system with advanced features including SLA support, custom fields, templates, tags, and CC/BCC functionality.

## Current State Assessment
- Basic ticket system with title, description, priority, and attachments
- Simple role-based access control
- Limited customization options

## Future State Goal
- Advanced ticket management with SLA tracking
- Customizable fields for different ticket types
- Template system for common ticket scenarios
- Tagging system for better organization
- CC/BCC functionality for ticket notifications
- Enhanced role-based access control

## Role-Based Interface Requirements

### Customer Interface
- Simplified ticket creation form:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Attachments
  - Category (optional)
  - CC/BCC fields
- No access to:
  - Priority selection
  - Department selection
  - Internal notes
  - SLA settings
  - Custom fields marked as internal
- View-only access to:
  - Assigned agent
  - Status updates
  - Public responses

### Agent Interface
- Full ticket management:
  - All basic fields
  - Priority selection
  - Department selection
  - Customer selection/assignment
  - Internal notes
  - Tag management
  - Custom fields (all)
  - Template selection
- Additional features:
  - Bulk ticket updates
  - Response templates
  - Time tracking
  - File attachments
  - CC/BCC management

### Admin Interface

  - SLA policy management
  - Template creation/management
  - Custom field configuration
  - Department management
  - Tag creation/management
  - Bulk actions across all tickets
  - Access to all internal notes
  - System configuration
  - Reporting and analytics

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Database Schema Enhancement ✓
- [x] Create SLA policy table and relationships
- [x] Add custom fields system
- [x] Implement template system
- [x] Add tagging functionality
- [x] Create CC/BCC tracking
- [x] Update RLS policies for new features

### 2. Type System and Validation ✓
- [x] Generate TypeScript types from Supabase schema
- [x] Create Zod schemas for validation:
  - [x] Base schemas (attachments, tags, custom fields)
  - [x] Ticket schemas (basic info, priority, watchers)
  - [x] Template schemas
  - [x] API request/response schemas
  - [x] SLA policy schemas

### 3. UI Components (Pending)
- [ ] Update ticket creation form with new fields
- [ ] Create template management interface
- [ ] Add tag management UI
- [ ] Implement custom field configuration
- [ ] Add SLA policy management
- [ ] Update ticket list with new features

### 4. API Implementation (Pending)
- [ ] Create API routes for new features
- [ ] Implement CRUD operations for:
  - [ ] Templates
  - [ ] Tags
  - [ ] Custom fields
  - [ ] SLA policies
- [ ] Add validation using Zod schemas

### 5. Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for Zod schemas
- [ ] Integration tests for new API endpoints
- [ ] E2E tests for new UI features
- [ ] Performance testing for complex queries
- [ ] Security testing for RLS policies

## Progress Updates
- 2025-01-22: Initial schema migration created and pushed to remote
- 2025-01-22: TypeScript types generated from updated schema
- 2025-01-22: Zod schemas created for all new features

## Next Steps
1. Begin UI component implementation
2. Create API routes using new schemas
3. Update existing components to use new features
4. Add test coverage for new functionality

## Notes
- All schema changes are backward compatible
- New features are protected by RLS policies
- TypeScript types and Zod schemas are in sync with database schema
