# UI Analysis and Next Steps

## Task Objective
Analyze screenshot results across all roles to identify missing components, layout issues, and required improvements for the AutoCRM interface.

## Current State Assessment
Based on screenshot analysis:

1. **Layout Issues**
   - No main content containers found across all pages
   - Missing proper layout structure (main, container classes)
   - Pages are rendering but lack proper semantic structure

2. **Role-Specific Pages Status**
   - Customer Role:
     - `/tickets` - Basic structure present but no content container
     - `/profile` - Page exists but needs layout structure
     - `/settings` - Page exists but needs layout structure

   - Agent Role:
     - `/queue` - Basic page exists but needs content
     - `/templates` - Page structure present but empty
     - `/workspace` - Needs complete implementation

   - Admin Role:
     - `/departments` - Basic structure but needs content
     - `/reports` - Page exists but needs implementation
     - `/team` - Basic structure but needs content
     - `/settings` - Needs role-specific settings

3. **Common Issues**
   - Missing proper semantic HTML structure
   - No loading states implemented
   - No error boundaries set up
   - Missing accessibility landmarks
   - Empty state handlers not implemented

## Future State Goal
1. Implement proper layout structure across all pages
2. Add missing UI components and content
3. Ensure consistent user experience across roles
4. Implement proper loading and error states

## Implementation Plan

4. Admin Pages (Priority: Medium)
   - [ ] Create department management interface
   - [ ] Build team management system

5. Common Components (Priority: High)
   - [ ] Add loading states

   - [ ] Improve accessibility

6. Testing and Validation
   - [ ] Run screenshot tests after each major component

## Notes
- Focus on completing high-priority items first
- Maintain consistent design language across all interfaces
- Ensure proper error handling and loading states
- Regular screenshot testing to validate changes
