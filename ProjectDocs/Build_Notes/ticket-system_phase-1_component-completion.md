# Ticket System Phase 1 - Component Completion Status

## Task Objective
Track and complete all necessary components for the ticket management system, ensuring proper functionality and user experience.

## Current State Assessment
Several core components have been created but some are incomplete or missing dependencies.

## Future State Goal
All components should be fully functional, properly typed, and include necessary dependencies.

## Implementation Plan

- [x] TicketDetail
- [ ] TicketMessages (separate component needed)
- [ ] TicketReplyForm (separate component needed)
- [ ] TicketStatusBadge (for consistent status styling)
- [ ] TicketPriorityBadge (for consistent priority styling)

### 2. Ticket Creation Components

- [ ] useTicketFilters (manage ticket filtering)

### 6. Type Definitions
- [ ] Update ticket.d.ts with complete type coverage

- [ ] Document type exports and usage

### 7. Testing Components
- [ ] Add unit tests for critical components
- [ ] Add integration tests for ticket workflows
- [ ] Add screenshot tests for all states

## Notes
- Components should follow the established design system
- All components should be properly typed with TypeScript
- Components should handle loading, error, and empty states
- Follow accessibility guidelines for all interactive elements
- Maintain consistent prop naming across components
